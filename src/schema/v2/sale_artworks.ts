    This is kind of weird, so here's what happened. During the v1 -> v2 migration,
    this type was only accessible under `Me` and includeArtworksByFollowedArtists
    was always true. A TODO (see below) was left to clean this up, but before it
    could be cleaned up, the type was already being used elsewhere. We need to keep
    the schema backwards-compatible while also allowing non-`Me` uses to have undefined
    for this argument. So we use this workaround.

    See: https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/blob/e1c227edc16ac0f38ab28db73c32c26bd8b9d5d7/src/schema/v2/sale_artworks.ts#L74-L77
